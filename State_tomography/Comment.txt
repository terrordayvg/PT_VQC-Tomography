Main is main.py, in this file you compare the swap test with the compilation test.

It calls:
main.Adam_QST    - output: Loss vector of CX_Swap, fidelity of CX_Swap
Cry_swap.py      - output: Loss vector of CRY_Swap, fidelity of CRY_Swap
Compare_W.py     - output: Loss vector of CRY_Vd, Loss vector of CX_Vd
