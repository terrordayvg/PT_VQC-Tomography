Code for figure 8 in the mentioned article: "Optimal depth and a novel approach to variational
unitary quantum process tomography"

·The most important function that can be found in qst_code.py is "QST(N, depth, iterations)".
 It takes an input:
  -N: The number of qubits of the targeted state.
  -depth: The depth of the variational quantum circuit that is going to be built.
  -iterations: Number of iterations used in the Adam subroutine.
 It outpus, in this order:
  -final_cost: The final value obtained for the cost function.
  -thetas: The learnt parameters of the variational quantum circuit

·The most important function to be found in attack_qst_code.py is "Forgery_QST(W_Haar, T, A, w, thetas)".
 It takes, as an input:
  -W_Haar: The unitary defining the QPUF to be attacked. A Haar-random one by default.
  -T: Target size.
  -A: Ancilla size.
  -w: Parameter deciding if SVD attack is launched (w=0), a random attacked is launched (w=1) or the user behaviour is simulated (w=2).
  -thetas: Learnt parameters for the variational quantum circuit.
  This fuction ouptuts:
    -Absolute deviation between generation outcome to be forgered and the one obtained at verification. In a cyclic fashion, that is, the 
     largest possible outcome, "2^A-1", preceeds the very first one, "0".
