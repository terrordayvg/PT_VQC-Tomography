# PT_VQC-Tomography
This repository combines all the codes to produce the plots and results from the following article: -----
A classical DNN attack has also been included, with the objective of recreating the initial state vector of each user based on the post-measurement classical output in QEPUF.
Additionally, the repository was complemented with the 1 qubit code for state emulation from the work of arXiv:1606.02734.

To install all the basic packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
